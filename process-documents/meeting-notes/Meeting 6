Assessed how much we had got done since the last meeting.
We decided that we needed to start making time estimations for the completion of each of our tasks to ensure that our goals were realistic and achievable in a given timeframe
Continued to discuss designs and how we were going to implement them (bootstrap etc)
Connecting app to the database and creating a login system was the next goal
