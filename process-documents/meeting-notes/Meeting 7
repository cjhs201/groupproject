 - We met our goals for our last meeting (login system made, database incorporation)
 - Assessed what we aimed to get done for our next submission. 
   A key part of this was deploying our app so that it could be accessed online
 - We decided on using heroku to deploy our app as it works well with django and can be linked with github 
   (so once set up itâ€™s very easy to deploy updated implementations of our app)
